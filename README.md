# Car-Models
this repo playing with the API of https://www.fueleconomy.gov
Author: Juan Carlos S. Laran

# Note
1. There are tons of API Calls since selection of cars is each called and this limited only to a 0-100 span (prone to change for performance).
2. There are unique ID within the XML of the API but same values, filtering is done within the JS file itself thus making unnecessary API calls.
3. This version would always undergo development and improvement to add more feutures.
